    q: "How does this work?",
    a: `Santa was eager to inspire interest in science, technology, and worldwide cultures to children throughout the world. As a result Santa partnered with us and allowed for a Global Positioning Device to be placed on his sleigh to show his worldwide trip.`,

    q: "Why doesn't Santa move constantly?",
    a: `Santa moves too fast! He is just too fast for our tracking devices to pick up all of Santa's movements. We are only able to get his general location each minute.`,
  },
  {
    q: "How does this use my location?",
    a: `The Santa Tracker uses your location to update the map to show how Santa will travel directly to your location! If you're not interested with sharing your location, that is absolutely okay! The next two questions are related to your location and how we predict Santa's path.`,
  },
  {
    q: "What is the dashed line?",
    a: `Based on the past several Christmas's, we predict Santa's path to your community in the last hour or so of his journey toward you.`,

  {
    q: "Why doesn't santa go directly over my house?",
    a: `He absolutely goes to your house! We are only able to get your regional location. So we just track Santa there!`,
  },
